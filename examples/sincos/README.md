# sincos

Sincos is a sample project that demonstrates basic kogu integration to Python using helper library.  
It trivially calculates sine and cosine function values, and reports them to kogu.  

## Instructions

* Make sure you have dependencies installed:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

* Run experiments (add [execution options](https://kogu.io/docs/cli.html) to taste):  
  `kogu run src/sincos.py`  

* Explore results in terminal or browser:  
  `kogu list`  
  `http://localhost:8193`
