# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. They are essential for keeping Kogu great.  
Feel free to report issues, send comments and suggest changes.  
Before submitting code, please make sure your changes conform to the unit tests:  
`python -m unittest tests.KoguTests`

Our dream is to integrate Kogu with all Data Science platforms and languages.  
This would be easier with specific helper libraries, like this one for Python.  
One day you might realize you need similar one for another environment you prefer to work at.  
We kindly invite you to initiate its development by creating a draft version.  
You can use this Python code and documentation (to be published soon) as a starting point.
